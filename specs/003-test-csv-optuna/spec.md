## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A data scientist needs to improve classification performance on test data by finding optimal hyperparameters for multiple machine learning models. They want to systematically explore hyperparameter spaces using Bayesian optimization to achieve better F1-macro scores than baseline models, ultimately producing high-quality predictions for competition submission.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** trained baseline models from initial comparison, **When** hyperparameter optimization is performed, **Then** optimized models should achieve F1-macro scores equal to or better than baseline performance
2. **Given** multiple models (QDA, SVC, RandomForest, DecisionTree), **When** Optuna optimization runs with 5-fold cross-validation, **Then** each model should have optimal hyperparameters identified within reasonable time constraints
3. **Given** optimized models, **When** predictions are generated on test.csv, **Then** submission files should be created in the correct format with predictions for all test samples
4. **Given** optimization process completion, **When** results are reviewed, **Then** performance improvements should be quantified and documented with training times

### Edge Cases
- What happens when optimization fails to improve over baseline performance?
- How does the system handle models that take excessively long to train during optimization?
- What if test.csv has different feature distributions than training data?
- How are pruned trials (early-stopped unsuccessful attempts) tracked and reported?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-006**: System MUST use 5-fold Stratified Cross-Validation for all model evaluations during optimization
- **FR-007**: System MUST track and report F1-macro scores as the primary optimization metric
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement trial pruning to terminate unpromising optimization attempts early
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate predictions on test.csv using optimally tuned models
