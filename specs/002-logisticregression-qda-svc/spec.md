## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a data scientist, I want to train and evaluate multiple classification models (LogisticRegression, QDA, SVC, RandomForest, DecisionTree) on the same dataset so that I can compare their performance and select the best model for predicting categorical outcomes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a prepared dataset, **When** I train multiple models (LogisticRegression, QDA, SVC, RandomForest, DecisionTree), **Then** each model successfully completes training without errors
2. **Given** trained models, **When** I evaluate their performance using stratified k-fold cross-validation, **Then** I receive standardized performance metrics for each model
3. **Given** performance metrics from multiple models, **When** I compare results, **Then** I can clearly identify which model performs best
4. **Given** multiple evaluation metrics, **When** I review model performance, **Then** I can see metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a model fails to train due to data incompatibility?
- How does the system handle models with different training time requirements?
- What happens if two models have identical performance metrics?
- How does stratified k-fold cross-validation handle datasets with severe class imbalance?
- What happens if a fold contains insufficient samples of a minority class?

## Required Clarifications

Before proceeding to planning phase, please clarify:

1. **Dataset**: Which dataset should be used? Is this for an existing project dataset or new data?
2. **Performance Metrics**: Which specific metrics are required? (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, etc.)
3. **Task Type**: Is this a classification or regression problem?
4. **Additional Models**: Beyond LogisticRegression, QDA, and SVC, which other models should be included? (RandomForest, XGBoost, KNN, NaiveBayes, etc.)
5. **Evaluation Method**: Should evaluation use cross-validation or a single train-test split?
