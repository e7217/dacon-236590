## Summary
This feature implements a comprehensive model evaluation pipeline to train and compare multiple classification models (LogisticRegression, QDA, SVC, RandomForest, DecisionTree) on the existing Dacon Smart Manufacturing competition dataset. The system will use stratified k-fold cross-validation to handle class imbalance and evaluate models using standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). The implementation follows the constitutional principle of Jupyter notebook-first development with all code implemented directly in notebook cells, prioritizing educational clarity and performance-first optimization. **Per user requirement: TDD is not needed as this is data analysis work - all code will be implemented within the Jupyter notebook**.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12
**Primary Dependencies**: scikit-learn>=1.3.0, pandas>=2.3.2, numpy>=1.24.0, matplotlib>=3.7.0, seaborn>=0.12.0
**Storage**: Data files in data/ directory, existing project dataset
**Testing**: Notebook-based validation with cross-validation results (no separate test files)
**Target Platform**: Jupyter notebook environment, local Python execution
**Project Type**: Data Science Competition - Notebook-based analysis
**Performance Goals**: Maximize classification accuracy/F1-score on Dacon competition metrics
**Constraints**: Must use stratified k-fold cross-validation, minimum 5-fold as per constitution
**Scale/Scope**: 5 classification models, existing competition dataset, comparative evaluation

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitutional Principles Compliance:**
- [x] **Jupyter Notebook-First**: All implementation in `06_model_comparison.ipynb` organized by evaluation stages
- [x] **Educational Clarity**: Each model and metric explained with 10-year-old level analogies
- [x] **Performance-First**: Focus on stratified k-fold CV with standard metrics, comparing all models systematically
- [x] **Research-Driven**: Incorporate best practices for multi-model comparison and cross-validation strategies
- [x] **Iterative Reflection**: Each model evaluation section includes reflection on results and potential improvements

**Justification**: This feature aligns perfectly with constitutional principles. It's a data science task requiring notebook-based implementation with educational documentation, performance comparison as the primary goal, and structured analysis with reflection. **User clarification: TDD is not necessary for data analysis work - all code will be implemented within the Jupyter notebook with inline helper functions.**

**Structure Decision**: **Pure notebook-only implementation** per user requirement. The main work happens entirely in `06_model_comparison.ipynb` with all helper functions defined inline within notebook cells. No separate utility modules in `src/evaluation/`, no test files in `tests/evaluation/`. This maintains the educational notebook structure and follows data analysis best practices where code organization happens through notebook sections rather than separate modules.

**User Requirement**: "데이터분석이 목적이니까 TDD는 필요없다. 코드도 주피터 노트북 내에 모두 구현한다." (Since the purpose is data analysis, TDD is not necessary. All code should be implemented within the Jupyter notebook.)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - Output format preference (FR-12) - resolved during research
   - Hyperparameter tuning approach - decided: use default parameters for fair comparison
   - Cross-validation fold count - constitutional requirement: minimum 5-fold

2. **Research tasks**:
   - Best practices for multi-model comparison in classification tasks
   - Stratified k-fold cross-validation implementation patterns
   - Visualization strategies for model performance comparison
   - Handling model training failures gracefully
   - Performance metric calculation for multi-class classification

3. **Technology decisions**:
   - Use scikit-learn's StratifiedKFold for cross-validation
   - Use scikit-learn's classification_report and confusion_matrix
   - Use matplotlib/seaborn for visualization
   - Use pandas DataFrame for results aggregation
   - Store results in structured format for easy comparison

**Output**: research.md with consolidated findings and decisions

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - ModelEvaluationResult: model_name, metrics, training_time, fold_scores
   - CrossValidationRun: model, dataset, n_folds, stratification_strategy
   - PerformanceMetrics: accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score
   - ComparisonReport: all_results, rankings, visualizations
   - **NOTE**: These entities are conceptual structures to guide notebook implementation, not separate classes

2. **Generate validation scenarios** → `quickstart.md`:
   - Scenario 1: Train all 5 models successfully
   - Scenario 2: Evaluate with stratified k-fold CV
   - Scenario 3: Display performance comparison clearly
   - Scenario 4: Handle model training failures
   - **NOTE**: Validation happens through notebook execution, not pytest

3. **Update CLAUDE.md incrementally**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - Add new evaluation framework tech
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md (conceptual entities), quickstart.md (notebook validation), CLAUDE.md
**NOTE**: No contracts/ directory created - TDD not required for data analysis

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks for notebook-only implementation
- Focus on notebook cells organized by purpose
- Each major section → implementation task
- Educational markdown cells → documentation tasks
- Reflection sections → analysis tasks

**Task Breakdown**:
1. Setup tasks: Create notebook file, import dependencies
2. Data loading tasks: Load existing competition dataset, verify shape
3. CV configuration tasks: Setup StratifiedKFold with 5 folds
4. Helper function tasks: Define inline metrics calculator, CV runner, comparator
5. Model evaluation tasks: Implement evaluation for each model (5 tasks) [P]
6. Comparison tasks: Aggregate results into DataFrame
7. Visualization tasks: Create bar charts and box plots
8. Reflection tasks: Document learnings and improvements

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Sequential notebook workflow: Setup → helpers → evaluations → comparison → reflection
- Parallel opportunities: Model evaluations (5 models) can be documented in parallel [P]
- Educational order: Concept introduction → implementation → results → reflection

**Estimated Output**: 12-15 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (execute notebook cells, verify cross-validation results)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations detected - all principles fully aligned*

This feature perfectly aligns with the constitutional requirements:
- Jupyter notebook-first development (Principle I) - **ENHANCED**: Pure notebook implementation
- Educational clarity with 10-year-old explanations (Principle II)
- Performance-first with systematic comparison (Principle III)
- Research-driven best practices (Principle IV)
- Iterative reflection sections (Principle V)

**User Clarification**: TDD approach removed per user requirement - data analysis work does not require separate test files or utility modules. All implementation happens in notebook cells.

No complexity deviations to justify.
