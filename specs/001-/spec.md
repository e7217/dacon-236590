## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data scientist working on the Dacon smart manufacturing anomaly detection competition, I need to have a well-organized project structure so that I can easily locate analysis scripts, notebooks, models, visualizations, and documentation. The current project has files scattered in the root directory, making it difficult to navigate and understand the project workflow.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a project with scattered files in the root directory, **When** the reorganization is complete, **Then** all files should be categorized into logical folders based on their purpose (analysis, models, visualizations, documentation, experiments, etc.)

2. **Given** multiple Python scripts performing similar tasks, **When** reviewing the organized structure, **Then** related scripts should be grouped together with clear naming conventions indicating their purpose

3. **Given** various output files (CSV submissions, PKL models, PNG visualizations), **When** navigating the project, **Then** outputs should be separated from source code and organized by type

4. **Given** documentation files (README, PROJECT_SUMMARY, analysis reports), **When** looking for project information, **Then** all documentation should be centralized and easily discoverable

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: How should multi-purpose files be handled (e.g., a script that does both analysis and generates submissions)? ‚Üí A: Place in primary purpose directory, document secondary purpose in README
- Q: Which directory name for visualization files (PNG)? ‚Üí A: outputs/figures/ - structured under outputs/ with other output files
- Q: How to manage large binary files (models, processed data)? ‚Üí A: Add to .gitignore to exclude from repository, local generation only
- Q: How to handle filename conflicts during reorganization? ‚Üí A: Manual review to decide whether to deduplicate or merge

### Edge Cases
- How should temporary or experimental files be handled?
- Where should configuration files and environment settings be placed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST categorize all Python scripts (.py files) into logical groups: exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, modeling (baseline/advanced), submission generation, and experiment tracking. For multi-purpose scripts, place in primary purpose directory and document secondary purposes in that directory's README

- **FR-002**: System MUST organize all Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) into a dedicated notebooks directory, with clear naming indicating analysis stage (e.g., 01_eda.ipynb, 02_preprocessing.ipynb, 03_modeling.ipynb)

- **FR-003**: System MUST separate data files into appropriate subdirectories: raw data in `data/raw/`, processed data in `data/processed/`, and trained models in `models/`. Large binary files (*.pkl, processed datasets) MUST be added to .gitignore to prevent repository bloat

- **FR-004**: System MUST group all visualization outputs (PNG files) into the `outputs/figures/` directory with descriptive naming

- **FR-005**: System MUST consolidate documentation files (README.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, analysis reports from `answers/`) into a `docs/` directory

- **FR-006**: System MUST organize submission files (CSV outputs) into a `submissions/` directory with timestamps or version numbers in filenames

- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the existing `src/` directory structure but ensure it contains only reusable source code modules (not scripts or notebooks)

- **FR-008**: System MUST keep experiment tracking outputs (`mlruns/`, `wandb/`) within the `experiments/` directory

- **FR-009**: System MUST create a clear directory structure that aligns with the constitutional principle of stage-based analysis workflow (EDA ‚Üí Preprocessing ‚Üí Modeling ‚Üí Evaluation)

- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve all configuration files (pyproject.toml, .gitignore, .python-version) in the root directory for tool compatibility

- **FR-011**: System MUST document the new file organization structure with a directory tree and file purpose descriptions

- **FR-012**: When filename conflicts occur during reorganization, system MUST flag conflicts for manual review to determine whether files should be deduplicated, merged, or renamed with context-specific suffixes

### Key Entities

- **Analysis Scripts**: Python files performing data analysis, visualization, or exploration tasks
  - Current location: Root directory (eda.py, advanced_analysis.py)
  - Purpose: Execute specific analysis workflows
  - Relationship: Generate visualizations and insights

- **Model Training Scripts**: Python files for training machine learning models
  - Current location: Root directory (baseline_models.py, advanced_ensemble.py, final_solution.py)
  - Purpose: Train, evaluate, and persist ML models
  - Relationship: Consume processed data, produce model artifacts

- **Preprocessing Scripts**: Python files for data cleaning and transformation
  - Current location: Root directory (preprocessing.py)
  - Purpose: Transform raw data into model-ready format
  - Relationship: Consume raw data, produce processed data

- **Submission Scripts**: Python files generating competition submission files
  - Current location: Root directory (simple_submission.py, quick_baseline.py)
  - Purpose: Create formatted CSV files for competition submission
  - Relationship: Use trained models to generate predictions

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks combining code, visualizations, and narrative
  - Current location: Root directory (main.ipynb)
  - Purpose: Interactive analysis and documentation
  - Relationship: Central to educational and iterative analysis workflow

- **Visualization Outputs**: PNG image files showing analysis results
  - Current location: Root directory (class_distribution.png, correlation_heatmap.png, etc.)
  - Purpose: Visual representation of data patterns and model results
  - Relationship: Generated by analysis scripts and notebooks

- **Model Artifacts**: Serialized models and preprocessors
  - Current location: Root directory (preprocessor_*.pkl, processed_data_*.pkl)
  - Purpose: Persist trained models and transformers for reuse
  - Relationship: Generated by training scripts, used by submission scripts

- **Documentation**: Markdown files describing project, plans, and results
  - Current location: Root and `answers/` directory
  - Purpose: Project documentation and analysis reports
  - Relationship: Reference all other entities for comprehensive understanding
